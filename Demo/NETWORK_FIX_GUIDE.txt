                      Troubleshooting & Solution Guide
                          November 11, 2025
================================================================================

✅ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED & SOLVED

Issue: Local network link (http://192.168.31.94:5000) was not opening
Root Cause: Flask was configured to listen only on localhost (127.0.0.1)
Solution: Changed Flask to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)

================================================================================

================================================================================

✅ NOW WORKING:

================================================================================

FILE: Demo/app.py
LINE: 103

BEFORE (localhost only):
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(debug=True, host='127.0.0.1', port=5000)

AFTER (network accessible):

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING - IF STILL NOT LOADING
================================================================================

❌ PROBLEM: Still can't access http://192.168.31.94:5000

✓ SOLUTION 1: Check if Flask is running
   • Look in terminal for: "Running on http://192.168.31.94:5000"
   • If not shown, restart: python app.py
   • Wait 5 seconds for startup

✓ SOLUTION 2: Check WiFi connection
   • Your computer must be on the network
   • Check other devices can see your WiFi
   • Make sure you're not on a VPN

✓ SOLUTION 3: Check firewall
   • Windows Firewall might be blocking
   • Go to Windows Defender Firewall
   • Allow Python through the firewall
   • Click "Allow an app through firewall"
   • Check "Python" or "python.exe"

✓ SOLUTION 4: Use different port
   • If port 5000 is blocked by firewall
   • Edit app.py last line: port=8000 (or 9000)
   • Restart Flask
   • Access at: http://192.168.31.94:8000

✓ SOLUTION 5: Restart WiFi
   • Disconnect and reconnect to WiFi
   • Restart your computer
   • Try accessing again

✓ SOLUTION 6: Try localhost first
   • Open: http://127.0.0.1:5000
   • If this works, it's a network issue
   • Ask IT to check firewall settings

================================================================================
💻 QUICK RESTART GUIDE
================================================================================

If Flask stops working or you need to restart:

STEP 1: Kill old Flask process
   taskkill /F /IM python.exe

STEP 2: Wait 2 seconds

STEP 3: Navigate to Demo folder
   cd "c:\Users\amira\OneDrive\Desktop\TribalLink Smart Digital Network for Tribal Empowerment\Demo"

STEP 4: Start Flask again
   python app.py

STEP 5: Wait for startup message
   Look for: "Running on http://192.168.31.94:5000"

STEP 6: Test the link
   Open: http://192.168.31.94:5000

Done! Should be working now ✅

🌐 NETWORK ACCESS EXPLANATION
================================================================================

What changed:
   host='127.0.0.1' → Only your computer can access (localhost)
   host='0.0.0.0' → Any device on the network can access

Why this works:
   • 0.0.0.0 means "listen on all network interfaces"
   • Your computer's IP is 192.168.31.94
   • Other devices can reach you at that IP address
   • So they can access http://192.168.31.94:5000

Security note:
   • Only devices on YOUR WiFi can access (router provides security)
   • External internet users cannot access
   • Safe for internal team use
   • Not suitable for production without additional security

================================================================================
✅ CHECKLIST - EVERYTHING WORKING

📞 FOR TEAM MEMBERS WHO CAN'T ACCESS

1. ASK: Are you on the same WiFi as Amira?
   → If NO, they must be on same WiFi
   → They need to connect to your WiFi first

2. ASK: Did you copy the exact link?
   → The link must be: http://192.168.31.94:5000
   → With http:// (not https://)
   → Exact IP address 192.168.31.94

3. ASK: Can you ping the server?
   → Open Command Prompt
